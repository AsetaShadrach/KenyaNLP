Dem say 0 , It's the same people who will be confused when their financials show profit but their cash balance is different from the profit amount.

We have hired mid-level people without 2 years experience anywhere before. And the turnover rate among them is very high.Among the rest turnover is very low. Turnover rate is 🔑
