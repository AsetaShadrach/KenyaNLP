There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do‚Ä¶ ,"Sorry, not 2.5L but the 3L Flat 6 engine. "
 Ah yes. It's a flat 6. That bit had run over my memory..., 
  I am not a bystander. I know the car. Have driven it severally. The pics were sent to‚Ä¶ ,"  Now you should have started there and the conversation would have ended 4 tweets ago. Congratulations, good car"
 Bana., That one is a H6 EZ30 though.
There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do‚Ä¶ , The one that was at Whistling Moran?
 Okay. So unaiendea..., 
 260 is actually stock ata for this unit. So what have the tunes helped?," If the hp figures and torque figures ziko hivyo kwa dyno, then it has added, sidhani when he got it it had that power and torque output, notice torque is way more than standard, also I think power output is limited for different markets, the lowest you can get is 170hp"
  Yes. What do you think?,"  I think we ask the owner, we are after all just bystanders"
" Since it's not an ordinary buyer TA, the spec sheet should be as per the conventional descriptions.‚Ä¶ "," Max hp for most EJ20s up to the EJ25TT is around 350hp with stock internals, kama hajafanya butchering, iko sawa, ni vile most people wametune moti consider the amount of time and finances put in the car wanaskia kukufa wakiuza at market prices"
  I am told this wagon was first listed at 890K. Brokers wamepanga line kupanga. üòÖüòÖ,"  Hehe mwenyewe najua ata 850 anaeza uza. A 2009 BH5 costs 750ish for an NA auto and climbs up to 900ish for a ej20x MT or ""semi auto"" with tiptronic shifting, tuning, rims tires and other kosokoso, fair deal if you ask me lakini nitanego ajab"
 That's why nashangaa what's the target market for a tuned car. A tuned car kuuzia msee hajui terms kama antilag ni blunder., 
 Pops and bangs na antilag ziko na difference?," Nope, lakini ukiambia watu wengi antilag hawataelewa. It's only different na 2 step"
"Did they have to tell us about the 5,000Kms service though? üòÖüòÖAlso, why call it ""Tuned for Pops and Bangs""?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "," Pops and bangs is a tune coded into the ECU either in stage one or stage 2(car produces pops and bangs during downshifts, orgasmic af) , but hiyo mod list naona iko ja stage 2 tunes meaning it has been tuned to stage two, probably..."

"   Yes. No DSG. It's the 8 Speed CVT.On weight, makes sense. Does that mean the 2‚Ä¶ ",   Yup - if that is the route you want to go a GTI/R would make more sense If you want to go the Audi route has to be a Quattro A4/5 paired with the 3.0 Supercharged V6

There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do‚Ä¶ ,"Sorry, not 2.5L but the 3L Flat 6 engine. "
 Ah yes. It's a flat 6. That bit had run over my memory..., 
  I am not a bystander. I know the car. Have driven it severally. The pics were sent to‚Ä¶ ,"  Now you should have started there and the conversation would have ended 4 tweets ago. Congratulations, good car"
 Bana., That one is a H6 EZ30 though.
There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do‚Ä¶ , The one that was at Whistling Moran?
 Okay. So unaiendea..., 
 260 is actually stock ata for this unit. So what have the tunes helped?," If the hp figures and torque figures ziko hivyo kwa dyno, then it has added, sidhani when he got it it had that power and torque output, notice torque is way more than standard, also I think power output is limited for different markets, the lowest you can get is 170hp"
  Yes. What do you think?,"  I think we ask the owner, we are after all just bystanders"
" Since it's not an ordinary buyer TA, the spec sheet should be as per the conventional descriptions.‚Ä¶ "," Max hp for most EJ20s up to the EJ25TT is around 350hp with stock internals, kama hajafanya butchering, iko sawa, ni vile most people wametune moti consider the amount of time and finances put in the car wanaskia kukufa wakiuza at market prices"
  I am told this wagon was first listed at 890K. Brokers wamepanga line kupanga. üòÖüòÖ,"  Hehe mwenyewe najua ata 850 anaeza uza. A 2009 BH5 costs 750ish for an NA auto and climbs up to 900ish for a ej20x MT or ""semi auto"" with tiptronic shifting, tuning, rims tires and other kosokoso, fair deal if you ask me lakini nitanego ajab"
 That's why nashangaa what's the target market for a tuned car. A tuned car kuuzia msee hajui terms kama antilag ni blunder., 
 Pops and bangs na antilag ziko na difference?," Nope, lakini ukiambia watu wengi antilag hawataelewa. It's only different na 2 step"
"Did they have to tell us about the 5,000Kms service though? üòÖüòÖAlso, why call it ""Tuned for Pops and Bangs""?üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "," Pops and bangs is a tune coded into the ECU either in stage one or stage 2(car produces pops and bangs during downshifts, orgasmic af) , but hiyo mod list naona iko ja stage 2 tunes meaning it has been tuned to stage two, probably..."
  Bana,  Napenda venye more people are appreciating Motorsports
"  When you enter in any car and switch on the ignition without turning on the engine, d‚Ä¶ ",  So you're saying that the engine is not on?
  Na pia jamaa ako na MT09. Alitutoka huku bana.,  Siet! dreams bana... Owning a fast car and bike
  Bana. Atokee.,  We're waiting on Club TT waseme Ile announcement
  Jade?,  Yes
  I hope sasa umeelewa...,  We also don't know for how long the engine has been running because that light should be gone in seconds. But Audi na VW are in a love relationship with that check engine light

   A 3L V6 ata haihitaji tune.,   Again Depends on the route you take and the size of your pockets That 3.0 has about 333HP stock People have gotten up to +130/140hp over stock with a supercharger pulley upgrade + tune
 ,"  Kuna ile video ya A4.. let me just say, if it‚Äôs not an A6, am not touching it"
"   Yes. No DSG. It's the 8 Speed CVT.On weight, makes sense. Does that mean the 2‚Ä¶ ",   Yup - if that is the route you want to go a GTI/R would make more sense If you want to go the Audi route has to be a Quattro A4/5 paired with the 3.0 Supercharged V6
   Are GTis and those tuned Jettas AWD? üòÖ,   Those have a +50hp advantage stock ontop of being about 200kgs lighter than the A4Plus that 1.8T didn't come with a dual-clutch box if I'm not wrong

 Bring Tinubu records and also peter obi and see who comes out at top. You can't say Tinubu was a fa‚Ä¶ ,  But it‚Äôs not fair to compare Lagos and Anambra states.

"      This is just few of what he did, same p‚Ä¶ ",      too many effective health centers. His educational reforms took Anambra to No.1 on WAEC and NECO rankings for 3 years.

      All what you are saying are excuses sir‚Ä¶ ,      terms of Infrastructural development? How much was raised and how much was spent? What about Security? What about transportation? How much was left when his tenure ended? You forget that statistics exist for a reason abi? Stop arguing blindly and check Olaudah Equiano's post!
      All what you are saying are excuses sir‚Ä¶ ,"      Tinubu as a matter of necessity, resorted to IGR income sources. How many computers were given to schools? How many schools were upgraded? How many Health centers were established? What was done in Malaria infection rates and Heart-related illness checkmating? What was done in"
