 Kenyans are  always peaceful lot. It's you who brings chaos n conflict for not accepting defeat.,  Yes it was Raila who roasted your fellow kikuyus huko kiambaa eldoret
  Who believes such nonsense.,

 There's no election rigging in Kenya. It's a lie crafted by  to justify his loss n a reason to cause mayhem n chaos .,  Even when the results are put to a test in the Supreme court and the rigging is proven you are still denying? This is the dishonesty I was talking about; denying the obvious
  What facts.? Table any evidence of rigging we see.,"  Pls check with kreiglers report (2007), &amp; the govt refusing to open the 2017 servers. I know u r not smart,  but the foregoing r enough evidence to indicate rigging of elections."
 Kenyans are  always peaceful lot. It's you who brings chaos n conflict for not accepting defeat.,  This is the kind of dishonesty that has plagued our country for years. The one who  rigs the election is good but the one who protests is the bad one. Have you ever imagined that the rigging could also benefit the candidate you don't like?
 Kenyans are  always peaceful lot. It's you who brings chaos n conflict for not accepting defeat.,"  The ""defeat"" manufactured by computers. Tharaka Nithi has never reached the population that voted in 2007, 15 yrs later,  taking into consideration kids &amp; the dead.  Servers of 2017 have never been opened to date."
  It remains a plus to Ruto.,   😂 😂 😂 Self consoling..

 Raila has never been an appointing authority.,  Maybe you were not born during the coalition government that's why you won't believe or understand

 Running mate is not a do or die affair to Kikuyus. We're supporting Ruto unconditionally.,  You will one day remember the ignorance in this tweet. Mark my words

 Running mate is not a do or die affair to Kikuyus. We're supporting Ruto unconditionally.,"  U didn't support him even b4 him declaring that, why shud are u concerned about him now, I will vote ruto unconditionally"
"     With kalonzo vying, is no longer a horse.",       Absolutely!
"  The right decision is joining azimio according to you..... Correct?. You lost Mudavadi to Ruto..,... Move on.",  Mudavadi has no political base.
 Running mate is not a do or die affair to Kikuyus. We're supporting Ruto unconditionally.,  For me I'll vote Raila Amolo Odinga ✅
  But Kikuyus are the largest voting block.,"  Granted, but they are divided.I know many Kikuyus like myself who will not vote Ruto. This time around, they have no capacity to take anyone to  State House. It seems to me you are refusing to see beyond your Kikuyu brain."
 Running mate is not a do or die affair to Kikuyus. We're supporting Ruto unconditionally.,  No one is giving you conditions to support Ruto. So just wait for the voting day and go and vote.But remember Kenya is larger than Kikuyus.

   A 3L V6 ata haihitaji tune.,   Haihitaji tune kufanya? 😂😂3.0T Audi A7/Q5 with a CVT will be munched by golfs all day.
  sio parody yako?,  😂
😅😅😅 such a good RS. Such a good car! 😅😅 , Hehe
"Sorry, not 2.5L but the 3L Flat 6 engine. ", Its a 3.0 H6
"  So who is hosting this etc...or rather, who are the organisers...",   Anonymous
How much would you pay for this 2008 Audi A4 1.8T? , 1.8M
There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do… ,"Sorry, not 2.5L but the 3L Flat 6 engine. "
 Ah yes. It's a flat 6. That bit had run over my memory..., 
  I am not a bystander. I know the car. Have driven it severally. The pics were sent to… ,"  Now you should have started there and the conversation would have ended 4 tweets ago. Congratulations, good car"
 Bana., That one is a H6 EZ30 though.
There is someone who got an NA Legacy BPL with 2.5L engine and went ahead to supercharge it. Some people really do… , The one that was at Whistling Moran?
 Okay. So unaiendea..., 
 260 is actually stock ata for this unit. So what have the tunes helped?," If the hp figures and torque figures ziko hivyo kwa dyno, then it has added, sidhani when he got it it had that power and torque output, notice torque is way more than standard, also I think power output is limited for different markets, the lowest you can get is 170hp"
  Yes. What do you think?,"  I think we ask the owner, we are after all just bystanders"
" Since it's not an ordinary buyer TA, the spec sheet should be as per the conventional descriptions.… "," Max hp for most EJ20s up to the EJ25TT is around 350hp with stock internals, kama hajafanya butchering, iko sawa, ni vile most people wametune moti consider the amount of time and finances put in the car wanaskia kukufa wakiuza at market prices"
  I am told this wagon was first listed at 890K. Brokers wamepanga line kupanga. 😅😅,"  Hehe mwenyewe najua ata 850 anaeza uza. A 2009 BH5 costs 750ish for an NA auto and climbs up to 900ish for a ej20x MT or ""semi auto"" with tiptronic shifting, tuning, rims tires and other kosokoso, fair deal if you ask me lakini nitanego ajab"
 That's why nashangaa what's the target market for a tuned car. A tuned car kuuzia msee hajui terms kama antilag ni blunder., 
 Pops and bangs na antilag ziko na difference?," Nope, lakini ukiambia watu wengi antilag hawataelewa. It's only different na 2 step"
"Did they have to tell us about the 5,000Kms service though? 😅😅Also, why call it ""Tuned for Pops and Bangs""?😂😂😂😂 "," Pops and bangs is a tune coded into the ECU either in stage one or stage 2(car produces pops and bangs during downshifts, orgasmic af) , but hiyo mod list naona iko ja stage 2 tunes meaning it has been tuned to stage two, probably..."
  Bana,  Napenda venye more people are appreciating Motorsports

  Na pia jamaa ako na MT09. Alitutoka huku bana.,  Siet! dreams bana... Owning a fast car and bike
  Bana. Atokee.,  We're waiting on Club TT waseme Ile announcement

 Link, 
   A 3L V6 ata haihitaji tune.,   Again Depends on the route you take and the size of your pockets That 3.0 has about 333HP stock People have gotten up to +130/140hp over stock with a supercharger pulley upgrade + tune
 ,"  Kuna ile video ya A4.. let me just say, if it’s not an A6, am not touching it"
"   Yes. No DSG. It's the 8 Speed CVT.On weight, makes sense. Does that mean the 2… ",   Yup - if that is the route you want to go a GTI/R would make more sense If you want to go the Audi route has to be a Quattro A4/5 paired with the 3.0 Supercharged V6
   Are GTis and those tuned Jettas AWD? 😅,   Those have a +50hp advantage stock ontop of being about 200kgs lighter than the A4Plus that 1.8T didn't come with a dual-clutch box if I'm not wrong

       So how would you value this car?,       Give or take around 800k to 1m depending na how clean the unit is.

 That car is not on. There are more lights there you should understand what's going on.,  So the seller tells us the car is not on. Any kindergarten knows the car is already switched on. But the engine is not yet on
How much would you pay for this 2008 Audi A4 1.8T? , 700k max..any audi that isn't quattro ni tricks

" Yes, especially if one is busy.", For me regardless of the situation I find myself replying fast or if I notice the other person is making it look like a favour texting back on several occasions I might reply much later like he or she did or not reply at all because it's like a cue that I'm disturbing.
" I see a message, reply in my head instead of actually replying.Then later realise I didn't reply.", 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️That actually happens?
" Owing to how I forget to reply to messages, I can't afford to be petty.", Like you honestly forget or you just don't really want to reply?😅😅

" Yes, especially if one is busy.", For me regardless of the situation I find myself replying fast or if I notice the other person is making it look like a favour texting back on several occasions I might reply much later like he or she did or not reply at all because it's like a cue that I'm disturbing.
" I see a message, reply in my head instead of actually replying.Then later realise I didn't reply.", 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️That actually happens?
" Owing to how I forget to reply to messages, I can't afford to be petty.", Like you honestly forget or you just don't really want to reply?😅😅

She is a Somali woman from Ogaden who saw the State of Ethiopia plan &amp; execute a genocide like it has done before in her own home region &amp; decided to resign &amp; speak about it &amp; expose an attempted cover up at the highest levels. That audacity is normal for Somalis.

 Why," Hakuna masomo inaendelea huko,watu hawajawahi rudi shule.A friend tells me,lecs na other staffs hawajailipwa,2019 strike kila students aliambiwa alipe 17k for damages yet hakuna renovation yoyote,shida kibao tu sana"
"If Arteta finishes out of top 4, then anafaa kutoka sasa", Funny thing is he sets such high standards for himself I don't see why we shouldn't set high standards for him as well. Top 4 or bounce.
   We don't care,    It's your favourite club Winston... you have to care😂😂😂😂
   We don't care,    Tell them
 We don't care,  🤣🤣
Read some comments that Matatus (14/11 seater) were meant to carry goods and not people...," Yeah, that's why even the windows are too small for one to get out from, incase of an accident"

"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", Lukas Perez Pro Max
 I thought tunamchukua on loan.... 58m ni mob sana, He has a fucking 58 million release clause maahn n Espanyol wants a straight buy.Am crying
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... "," 58 million for those numbers n he is 27.N we let Auba , Ozil, Mkhi leave for free?🥲🥲🥲"
 😭😭, Leo tunastarve mbaya sana😂
 4 penalty goals out of 12, Not bad but not great either
" Same,,, I've never watched him"," Watched a few things though,better dribbler and good in tight spaces,good movement in the box and is an outlet,makes runs and is fast"
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", Hio source imebreak hii news sio reliable
"If Arteta finishes out of top 4, then anafaa kutoka sasa", Top 5 ni sawa top 4 msipoingia itabidi mmeelewa. Spurs na Westham are stronger sides kuwaliko rn.
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", Whats his npg?
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", impressive stats elsewhere don't apply in the PL
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... "," His numbers are good,I’m not so sure though"

   As men the Problem comes when you introduce them to your Family &amp; Relatives,   It becomes a problem coz they want the best for you. Having anything serious with someone’s baby mama is a recipe for disaster! Know your worth and find someone you can start afresh together.

   They need to sit down and discuss it out,   He was told aende atafute wale hutembea uchi 😂😂. That woman knows her worth.
  Just invite her friends to your house &amp; tell them to look smart than her,   She will help you congratulate them while she is her UDA t-shirt like that's the life she has chosen.
   Honestly he needs to sit down with her &amp; have a heart to heart talk. Some issues… ,"   I think if he aired his concerns to her in an open manner...I think she would listen. His concerns would be addressed.And if you aren't able to do that, there is a bigger problem in that marriage than her dressing #SpiceDrive"
  Have you ever invited your friends over to your house &amp; all of them come with flashy items?,  Not really.But I see how the peer pressure may make you want to step up#SpiceDrive
   It works on anyone,   Honestly he needs to sit down with her &amp; have a heart to heart talk. Some issues come up because may be she feels he is controlling her

 Leo transfers ziko funny," Sana.. Kwanza hii ya Dele, wamework in total silence"
 Ako 6 goals away, Wee Mzee😂😂😂
100 Auba goals incoming , Am glad amerudi atafika Century of goals at least
 He's better than the two strikers we were left with, But he wasn't performing even before the incident I feel like he's past his prime Sasa we should go for new blood juu hata akibaki hatacheza
100 Auba goals incoming , Ni juu Dembele hadai kutoka 😅. Ata ya Adama sijui kama itapenya. Arteta won't bring him anytime soon though.
"If Arteta finishes out of top 4, then anafaa kutoka sasa", When**
 , 😂😂😂
 Wallahi inaeza kua.... amrudishe squad, Arteta has the ego of Jose Mourinho and a managerial ability that doesn't match that ego.  He won't play him.
" Atleast,  i hope arudishwe squad", Bana🤣🤣
 Arudishwe kwa squad sasa, Bana ...that guy is very crucial to our squad especially at this time.
 , Racist Arteta won't allow him to play

 ," Arteta to Aubameyang: ""Come back we need to talk""😂😂"
 , Arsenal pulled off the plug.. I can bet on it
Eddie stays😜 , Bwana this young man is never serious about playing for arsenal.  Very lazy. He needs Liverpool or Manchester City like. Mpira inakuja kwake tu. But arsenal whole 45 minutes anaweza guza mpira twice

   We don't care,

  Anetukataa bana,  Champions league ndo inafanya maplayer wawakatae.
 Worried about the squad depth though 😕, We don't really need a huge squad for 17 games.
 Why," Hakuna masomo inaendelea huko,watu hawajawahi rudi shule.A friend tells me,lecs na other staffs hawajailipwa,2019 strike kila students aliambiwa alipe 17k for damages yet hakuna renovation yoyote,shida kibao tu sana"
"If Arteta finishes out of top 4, then anafaa kutoka sasa", Funny thing is he sets such high standards for himself I don't see why we shouldn't set high standards for him as well. Top 4 or bounce.

 4 penalty goals out of 12, Not bad but not great either
" Same,,, I've never watched him"," Watched a few things though,better dribbler and good in tight spaces,good movement in the box and is an outlet,makes runs and is fast"
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", Hio source imebreak hii news sio reliable
"If Arteta finishes out of top 4, then anafaa kutoka sasa", Top 5 ni sawa top 4 msipoingia itabidi mmeelewa. Spurs na Westham are stronger sides kuwaliko rn.
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", Whats his npg?
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... ", impressive stats elsewhere don't apply in the PL
"Arsenal's target, Raul De Tomas numbers... "," His numbers are good,I’m not so sure though"
